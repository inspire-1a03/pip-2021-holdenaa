#### Summary
<!-- Write a 2-sentence summary of the trends shown in the figure embedded above-->

Since the beginning of the pandemic, the numbers for daily COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths have been categorized into 3 distinct waves, where all 3 measures have increased and then slowly decreased. The first wave didn't have as many daily cases as the following waves and there was a large increase in fatalities, however, the third wave that is currently on the decline, is seen to have more daily cases but fewer fatalities.

#### Summary
<!-- Write a 2-sentence summary of the trends shown in the figure embedded above-->

Testing in Ontario seemed to be slightly delayed, as there wasn't a distinct trend until April of 2020, however there was a very large and fairly linear increase in testing overtime. In terms of vaccination, the figure displays the slow administration over a few months that then began to increase dramatically through April of 2021.

#### Summary
<!-- Write a 2-sentence summary of the trends shown in the figure embedded above-->

Vaccination rates differ most distinctly between Canada's provinces and territories, as territories had a delayed rollout of vaccines, likely due to distribution considerations, but soon after showed a substantial increase. In comparison, the figure displays Canadian provinces' gradual increase in vaccinations over time.

#### Summary
<!-- Write a 2-sentence summary of the trends shown in the figure embedded above-->

Mobility trends clearly follow each COVID-19 wave in Canada, where most measures will increase travel in between each wave and decrease when amidst a wave. The most drastic peak is travel to parks and recreation in between the first and second wave, whereas measures such as travel to workplace or transit stations have remained low throughout the pandemic. 

## Final reflection
> What inferences can you make from the data you have explored and visualized? 
> What questions still exist about the trends and the data? What new questions has this process generated? 
> What additional information would you like to help answer these questions? 

<!-- Write a short response below-->

Working with the data provides an opportunity to visualize the progression of COVID-19, as the data allows us to see numbers in terms of hospitalizations, cases, fatalities, etc. This wide pool of data has also allowed me to understand aspects of the pandemic, such as vaccine distribution, from a national and provincial perspective.

When I review trends in the data, a question that still exists for myself is what are the social influences? It would be interesting to get some self-reported data to help explain certain trends. For example, is the drastic decrease in transit station mobility due to reported higher levels of people avoiding public transit? After reflecting on this data, a new question that arises for myself is how these trends compare to a year before COVID-19.

I would like to see some data from a time before COVID-19, to be able to compare the different trends.
