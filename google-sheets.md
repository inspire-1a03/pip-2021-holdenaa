Since the beginning of the pandemic, the numbers for daily COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths have been categorized into 3 distinct waves, where all 3 measures have increased and then slowly decreased. The first wave didn't have as many daily cases as the following waves and there was a large increase in fatalities, however, the third wave that is currently on the decline, is seen to have more daily cases but fewer fatalities.

In terms of vaccination, the figure displays the slow administration over a few months that then began to increase dramatically through April of 2021.

Vaccination rates differ most distinctly between Canada's provinces and territories, as territories had a delayed rollout of vaccines, likely due to distribution considerations, but soon after showed a substantial increase. In comparison, the figure displays Canadian provinces' gradual increase in vaccinations over time.
