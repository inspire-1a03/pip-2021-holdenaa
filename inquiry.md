#### Summary
<!-- Write a 2-sentence summary of the trends shown in the figure embedded above-->

inverse relationship
When evaluating the change in travel to parks previously, there was an evident relationship to COVID-19 case waves. By putting this data together, we are able to see that there is a strong inverse relationship with these measures, based on the increase in travel to parks when there are decreases in new cases.

#### Summary
<!-- Write a 2-sentence summary of the trends shown in the figure embedded above-->

The figure displays similar trends in grocery/pharmacy and retail/recreation travel in Canada. Although there is a distinctly similar pattern within this trend, travel to grocery and pharmacy is higher, likely due to minimization of non-essential travel, as well as the enforcement of lockdowns. It is important to note an initial discrepency in the similarity of this trend, as there was an increase in grocery and pharmacy travel, while there was a significant decrease in retail and recreation travel.

#### Summary
<!-- Write a 2-sentence summary of the trends shown in the figure embedded above-->

The figure displays that although there are similarities in the pattern of the travel to workplaces trend, it still varies greatly between Canadian regions. These differences exist due to Canada wide geographical diversity, that influences these trends as population distribution, number of cases, political influence, etc. The figure also highlights a contrasting and distinct trend of Ontario, one of the most densely populated regions, having yet to return even close to the original amount of travel to workplace.
