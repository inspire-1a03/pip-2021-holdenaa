# Exercise 3: Advanced visualization using Tableau


## 1. Mapping regional vaccination rates
> Q1: What is the current state of vaccinations among provinces and territories?  

<!-- Paste your embed code for your figure below-->

<iframe seamless frameborder="0" src="https://public.tableau.com/views/AH-covid-vaccination-map/Dashboard1?:embed=yes&:display_count=yes&:showVizHome=no" width = '650' height = '650' scrolling='no'></iframe> 

#### Summary
<!-- Write a 2-sentence summary of the trends shown in the figure embedded above-->

The vaccination rates between provinces vary greatly, with Newfoundland having the lowest rate and Yukon at the highest. It is evident that the vaccination rates of territories are higher than those of the provinces, due to smaller population sizes, creating a greater vaccination rate per 100 people.

## 2. Changes in travel to retail and recreation destinations for provinces/territories
> Q2: How has travel to recreation and retail locations changed over time between regions of Canada?

#### Summary
<!-- Write a 2-sentence summary of the trends shown in the figure embedded above-->

The changes in travel to recreation and retail location has varied amoungst different regions of Canada, based on political influence in the form of lockdowns, as well as the number of COVID-19 cases. There are distinct differences between these specific regions as a result of the  diverse population distributions and political decisions within each Canadian region.

## 3. Changes in travel to parks for Ontario counties/municipalities
> Q3: How has travel to parks changed over time in Ontario's counties/municipalities?  

<!-- Paste your embed code for your figure below-->

<iframe seamless frameborder="0" src="https://public.tableau.com/views/Parks_3_16223303334440/Dashboard1?:embed=yes&:display_count=yes&:showVizHome=no" width = '950' height = '650' scrolling='no'></iframe>

#### Summary
<!-- Write a 2-sentence summary of the trends shown in the figure embedded above-->

There is a similar trend regarding park use in Ontario counties/municipalities that clearly follows along with each wave of COVID-19 cases. The peak change from baseline occured in between the first and second wave then decreased through the second wave, remaining low until the end of the second wave. However, this similar trend has varying magnitudes base on the counties/municipalities that could possibly be due to park numbers and locations. 

## 4. Reflection 
> What are your initial thoughts about using Tableau vs. Google Sheets? What might be the advantages of each? 
> What inferences can you make from the Mobility data that you explored and visualized? 
> What new questions would you like to ask of the data? 
> How might you use these two datasets together to perform new analyses? 

<!-- Write a short response below-->

  Tableau is a very useful program when you understand the workings and proper shortcuts, while googlesheets seems slightly simpler to use. I think the advantage of using Tableau is that it is very good at interpreting the data from google sheets and creating effective visualizations. An advantage to googlesheets is that it has a similar format to excel, as well as the simple layout, that makes it feel easier and more accessible. 
  The mobility data clearly shows the patterns and trends of how we interact during the pandemic and are a reflection of each COVID-19 wave and strict lockdown. The fluctuations in the pattern of mobility seem to be most heavily impacted by the strict lockdowns over other stay at home orders. 
  Some new questions I would like to ask of the data is to specify mobility in terms of where people are from. Are these peaks in specific locations in Canada local or are people travelling from further away, to bend the rules of lockdown? For example, I have noticed many individuals have been travelling further out to go to municipalities within Ontario, where parks are open. 
  Using both datasets in pair would be very informative, as it would provide more information and connect these trends that can be seen within the data.
